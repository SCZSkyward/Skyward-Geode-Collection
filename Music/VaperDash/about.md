# Vaper Dash

Adds the unused mode left in Sonic Mania's files into the world of Geometry Dash.

This mod slows down the music by 0.75, along with the speed of the player. This however in turn will make any completions using this mod **invalid** due to the levels being slowed down to *try* to sync the music with the level.

When enabled, the ending screen for the level will show that you used a startpos to signify that you have the mod enabled.
